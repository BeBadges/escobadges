# Contributing to EscoBadges

First of all: we very much welcome all contributions so want to make it as easy as possible & don't want to build in any barriers (technical or practical) that would hold anyone back from contributing.

So don't hesitate to ask questions or get in touch if something is not clear or you have suggestions for improvements.

But to make sure that everything remains manageable and maintainable, there is this document (a work in progress) with some guidelines & best practices to contribute to this project.  
## How Can I contribute?

### Become a part of the community

Join our [slack](http://bebadges.herokuapp.com/) or [meetupgroup](https://www.meetup.com/Belgian-Open-Badges-Meetup/) and take part in community discussions & events.


### Report bugs or request features
If you have a feature request or bug you want to report, you can do so via posting [github issues](https://github.com/BeBadges/escobadges/issues).
Make sure before your post [to check the list of issues](https://github.com/BeBadges/escobadges/issues) if the **same issue hasn't already been posted**.

### Github workflow for developers
In the workflow we follow for this project, we would like to keep the relation between the issue tracker and the code as clear as possible.
So we suggest that each significant change to the code , should start with an issue where the goal is described.

The workflow we propose:
- **Create an issue** describing the desired change that you want to make (if it doesn't exist yet)
- When you (or someone else) is ready to code: **start a branch** for the issue from the master branch. The name of this branch should start **with the issue number** + description of the issue, for example '8-update-readme-file-with-installation-instruction'.
- When you are done you **open a pull request** to the master branch
- Before it is merged into the master branch , **it will be reviewed** . You can indicate when your pull request would be a Work in Progress & not ready to be merged yet (start the title of the pull request with "WIP:").

This way we can keep track on who is working on what.
